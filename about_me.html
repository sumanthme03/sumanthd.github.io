<h1>About Me</h1>
</div>
<p>I was born and brought up in the  industrial city of Bangalore.</p>
<p>My father is an Accountant  and is currently appointed as a Deputy General Manager in Promac Engineering Industries. 
My mother is a housewife. She holds a M.Sc and M.Phil in Botany from Utkal University where she was the University Topper. <br />
I consider myself very lucky to have done my schooling from Jyothy Kendriya Vidyalaya where I 
faced an extremely competitive environment right from my childhood. My school has been home to many exceptional people 
who have been a constant source of inspiration at every point in my school days. <br />

I take keen interest in Music. I like listening to Carnatic music . 
I am a trained classical singer and a beginner violinist (especially <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabla/">&ldquo;tabla&rdquo;</a>) .
